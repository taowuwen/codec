# myshaper - DSL/Cable modem outbound traffic shaper and prioritizer.
#            Based on the ADSL/Cable wondershaper (www.lartc.org)

# NOTE!! - This script assumes your kernel has been patched with the
#          appropriate HTB queue and IMQ patches available here:

#
# Configuration options for myshaper:
#  DEV    - set to ethX that connects to DSL/Cable Modem
#  RATEUP - set this to slightly lower than your
#           outbound bandwidth on the DSL/Cable Modem.
#           I have a 1500/128 DSL line and setting
#           RATEUP=90 works well for my 128kbps upstream.
#           However, your mileage may vary.
#  RATEDN - set this to slightly lower than your
#           inbound bandwidth on the DSL/Cable Modem.
#
#
#  Theory on using imq to "shape" inbound traffic:
#
#     It's impossible to directly limit the rate of data that will
#  be sent to you by other hosts on the internet.  In order to shape
#  the inbound traffic rate, we have to rely on the congestion avoidance
#  algorithms in TCP.  Because of this, WE CAN ONLY ATTEMPT TO SHAPE
#  INBOUND TRAFFIC ON TCP CONNECTIONS.  This means that any traffic that
#  is not tcp should be placed in the high-prio class, since dropping
#  a non-tcp packet will most likely result in a retransmit which will
#  do nothing but unnecessarily consume bandwidth.  
#     We attempt to shape inbound TCP traffic by dropping tcp packets
#  when they overflow the HTB queue which will only pass them on at
#  a certain rate (RATEDN) which is slightly lower than the actual
#  capability of the inbound device.  By dropping TCP packets that
#  are over-rate, we are simulating the same packets getting dropped
#  due to a queue-overflow on our ISP's side.  The advantage of this
#  is that our ISP's queue will never fill because TCP will slow it's
#  transmission rate in response to the dropped packets in the assumption
#  that it has filled the ISP's queue, when in reality it has not.
#     The advantage of using a priority-based queuing discipline is
#  that we can specifically choose NOT to drop certain types of packets
#  that we place in the higher priority buckets (ssh, telnet, etc).  This
#  is because packets will always be dequeued from the lowest priority class
#  with the stipulation that packets will still be dequeued from every
#  class fairly at a minimum rate (in this script, each bucket will deliver
#  at least it's fair share of 1/7 of the bandwidth).  
#
#  Reiterating main points:
#   * Dropping a tcp packet on a connection will lead to a slower rate
#     of reception for that connection due to the congestion avoidance algorithm.
#   * We gain nothing from dropping non-TCP packets.  In fact, if they
#     were important they would probably be retransmitted anyways so we want to
#     try to never drop these packets.  This means that saturated TCP connections
#     will not negatively effect protocols that don't have a built-in retransmit like TCP.
#   * Slowing down incoming TCP connections such that the total inbound rate is less
#     than the true capability of the device (ADSL/Cable Modem) SHOULD result in little
#     to no packets being queued on the ISP's side (DSLAM, cable concentrator, etc).  Since
#     these ISP queues have been observed to queue 4 seconds of data at 1500Kbps or 6 megabits
#     of data, having no packets queued there will mean lower latency.
#
#  Caveats (questions posed before testing):
#   * Will limiting inbound traffic in this fashion result in poor bulk TCP performance?
#     - Preliminary answer is no!  Seems that by prioritizing ACK packets (small <64b)
#       we maximize throughput by not wasting bandwidth on retransmitted packets
#       that we already have.
#   

# NOTE: The following configuration works well for my 
# setup: 1.5M/128K ADSL via Pacific Bell Internet (SBC Global Services)

DEV=eth0
RATEUP=90
RATEDN=700  # Note that this is significantly lower than the capacity of 1500.
# Because of this, you may not want to bother limiting inbound traffic
# until a better implementation such as TCP window manipulation can be used.

# 
# End Configuration Options
